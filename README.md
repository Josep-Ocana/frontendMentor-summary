## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Node.js

### What I learned

In this project I've just started to use Sass. It's a powerful tool to make css styles in most efficient way with Less code.

I've worked with node.js and webpack. It has been difficult because is the first time I've worked with both tools in a project. It has been a real challenge to take my project to production and make it work properly.

Some code Sass lines:

```Sass
.row {
	@extend %row;

	&-Reaction {
		@extend %row;
		@extend %row-Reaction;
	}
	&-Memory {
		@extend %row;
		@extend %row-Memory;
	}
    ...
}

```

### Continued development

I realised that I have to improve my Sass skills and node.js and the manner to take my project to production. It has very useful to me to learn it .

### Useful resources
